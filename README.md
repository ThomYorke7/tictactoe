Tic Tac Toe project inspired by the Odin Project with Singleplayer and Multiplayer game modes.  

The CSS code includes flexbox items and grids. The javascript part implements factory functions, modules and IIFEs. 
I tried to create an AI that does not choose randomly, but it does not use minimax() either, which would make the AI unbeatable.
This version should simulate human behaviour, since it mixes initial random moves with a basic interpretation of the opportunities to win or block the other player.
